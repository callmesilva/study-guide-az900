This will serve as my reinforcment notes to go through the AZ-900 exam

## Private endpoints
Private connectivity for PaaS applications, and can be used to expose an endpoint to VPNs
## Network Peering
* Can be virtual network peering if they're on the same region
* It is called global virtual network if they're on different regions
## Azure Policies
A set of rules defined so Azure can evaulate if the actual configuration is safe and complies with the organization security guidelines
## Azure Arc
* Solves overhead of managing on premises and AWS
## Azure Sentinel
* Sentinel is a **security** monitor, not a constant telemetry analyzer.
## Azure Monitor Alerts
## Conditional Access Policy
## IaaS
* Services can be scaled automatically to support system load
## Availability Set
* Remember that this consists of 2 or more virtual machines in the SAME phisical location (same availability zone)
## Redundancy Zones
* Study the differences and use-cases
## Cost Management
* Monitoring and analisis of costs of **current** Azure resources
## Pricing Calculator
* TODO: Find out the differences
## Role Based Access Credentials (RBAC)
* PLEASE STUDY THIS SHIT MAN
## Azure Privileged Identity Management
## PaaS
* App Service
* Azure Functions
* Azure SQL Database
## Reliability = Disaster recovery
## Azure AD
## Horizontal Scaling
* DOES NOT need downtime to increase compute capacity


## Defense in depth
-   The physical security layer is the first line of defense to protect computing hardware in the datacenter.
-   The identity and access layer controls access to infrastructure and change control.
-   The perimeter layer uses distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection to filter large-scale attacks before they can cause a denial of service for users.
-   The network layer limits communication between resources through segmentation and access controls.
-   The compute layer secures access to virtual machines.
-   The application layer helps ensure that applications are secure and free of security vulnerabilities.
-   The data layer controls access to business and customer data that you need to protect.
