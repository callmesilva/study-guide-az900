Containers to hold resources in groups

## ARM Benefits

You can deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group rather than handling these resources individually.
When you deploy your resources, you can be confident it happens in the same way every single time.
Your resources will be deployed in a consistent state.
You can define the dependencies between resources, ensuring that any new resources don't step on the toes of the others.
And you can easily decide which users have access to which resources using built-in features in the ARM.
You can logically organize all your resources using the tag feature. 
Tagging is assigning a label for each resource you can then sort and perform actions on.
And you can clarify your organization's billing by viewing costs for a group of resources sharing the same tag.
