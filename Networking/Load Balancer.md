*  **Load Balancer Purpose**:
    - Distributes traffic among multiple VMs.
    - Ensures efficient traffic management and prevents overloading a single VM.
- **Scenario**:
    - Online business experiencing increased traffic.
    - Initial VM overloaded, necessitating the addition of a second VM.
- **Functionality**:
    - Load balancer captures inbound traffic before it reaches VMs.
    - Distributes traffic to backend pool instances (VMs) based on rules and health probes.
- **Components**:
    - **Inbound Flows**: Any traffic from the internet or local VNet.
    - **Frontend**: The access point for all traffic to the VMs.
    - **Backend Pool Instances**: VMs receiving traffic from the load balancer.
    - **Rules and Health Probes**: Direct traffic and ensure VMs are ready to receive traffic.
- **Health Probes**:
    - Ensure VMs are healthy and ready to receive traffic.
    - Prevent traffic from being sent to unhealthy VMs.
- **Scenarios for Load Balancer Use**:
    - Balancing incoming traffic.
    - Balancing traffic from internal networks in Azure and hybrid scenarios.
    - Port forwarding to specific ports on specific machines.
    - Providing outbound connectivity for VMs in the backend pool.
- **Conclusion**:
    - Load balancers are essential for managing traffic and ensuring efficient operation of multiple VMs.
